echo "🚀 SEQICO Price Setting Functionality Demo"
echo "=========================================="

echo "📋 What this implementation provides:"
echo "  ✅ setPriceETH() - Set ETH price per token (min 0.001 ETH)"
echo "  ✅ setPriceUSDT() - Set USDT price per token (min \$3.00)"
echo "  ✅ setPriceUSDC() - Set USDC price per token (min \$3.00)"
echo "  ✅ Price validation enforcing \$3 minimum"
echo "  ✅ Owner-only access control"
echo "  ✅ Event logging for price changes"
echo "  ✅ Constructor validation"
echo

echo "💰 Price Floor Policy:"
echo "  • USDT/USDC minimum: 3,000,000 (representing \$3.00 with 6 decimals)"
echo "  • ETH minimum: 0.001 ETH (assuming ETH > \$3,000)"
echo

echo "📁 Files Added/Modified:"
echo "  📄 contracts/SEQICO.sol - Added price setter functions"
echo "  📄 test/SEQICO.test.js - Comprehensive test suite"
echo "  📄 scripts/set-prices.js - Price setting utility script"
echo "  📄 scripts/deploy.js - Updated with validation"
echo "  📄 scripts/deploy-DE.js - Updated with validation"
echo "  📄 README.md - Updated documentation"
echo

echo "🔧 Usage Examples:"
echo
echo "1. Deploy with validation:"
echo "   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js"
echo
echo "2. Set new prices after deployment:"
echo "   # Edit SEQICO_ADDRESS in set-prices.js first"
echo "   npx hardhat run scripts/set-prices.js"
echo
echo "3. Test the functionality:"
echo "   npx hardhat test"
echo

echo "⚠️  Important Notes:"
