# SEQICO Smart Contract Deployment

A Hardhat project for deploying the SEQICO ICO smart contract and SEQ token.

## Overview

This project contains:
- **SEQICO.sol**: The main ICO contract allowing token purchases with ETH, USDT, and USDC
- **SEQToken.sol**: The ERC20 token contract
- **Deployment scripts**: Two deployment scripts with different configurations

## Features

### SEQICO Contract
- Buy SEQ tokens with ETH, USDT, or USDC
- Configurable pricing for each payment method with $3 minimum validation
- Owner-only functions for token management and fund withdrawal
- Automatic ETH refunds for overpayments
- Event logging for all purchases

### SEQToken Contract
- Standard ERC20 token
- Initial distribution: 10% to owner, 90% to ICO contract
- 500,000 total supply

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Compile contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Deploy contracts:
```bash
# Deploy with main script
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

# Deploy with alternative script  
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-DE.js
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
